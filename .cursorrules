# Beacon Interaction Rules
# Automated service investigation and Beacon catalog workflows

## Default Service Investigation Workflow
When user asks to investigate a service:
1. **Start with Beacon URL**: https://beacon.autodesk.com/catalog?filters%5Buser%5D=all&filters%5Bkind%5D=component&limit=20
2. **Navigate to specific service**: https://beacon.autodesk.com/catalog/default/component/{service-name}
3. **Collect comprehensive data**:
   - Service owner and contacts
   - Deployment regions
   - Build status and history
   - Dependencies (upstream/downstream)
   - API endpoints
   - Health metrics

## Quick Commands
- `investigate {SERVICE}` → Full service investigation
- `check build {SERVICE}` → Latest build status
- `health {SERVICE}` → Health and deployment status
- `deps {SERVICE}` → Dependency analysis

## MCP Integration
- Use Playwright MCP for Beacon navigation
- Prefer automated workflows over manual steps
- Always capture structured data for analysis

## Standard URLs
- Catalog: https://beacon.autodesk.com/catalog?filters%5Buser%5D=all&filters%5Bkind%5D=component&limit=20
- Service template: https://beacon.autodesk.com/catalog/default/component/{service-name}
